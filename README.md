Dirty tricks to run python notebooks

![package-test-badge](https://github.com/alexandreCameron/boar/workflows/.github/workflows/package-test.yaml/badge.svg)

## Purpose

Testing an idea is sometimes more easily done by calling a python notebook in a python code.
It is practice as dirty, filthy and ugly as a boar...
But if you can prove the value of your idea, why not trying it out.

## Practice

I used this trick in CI jobs to make sure tutorials associated to a project stay up-to-date.

I would not recommend to use this code on a deployed product.
