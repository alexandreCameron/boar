Dirty tricks to run python notebooks

## Purpose

Sometimes testing an idea is easierly done but calling a python notebook in a python code.

It is a bad practice for production environments ...

But if you can prove the value of your idea, why not trying it out.

It's a dirty, filthy ugly like a boar but boars are not an endangered species.
