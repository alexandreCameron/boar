## Purpose

Testing an idea is sometimes more easily done by calling a python notebook in a python code.
It is practice as dirty, filthy and ugly as a boar...
But if you can prove the value of your idea, why not trying it out.

## Practice

I used this trick in CI jobs to make sure tutorials associated to a project stay up-to-date.

I would not recommend to use this code on a deployed product.

## Usage

Open [./USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) to view examples on how you can use `boar`.
