## Purpose

Testing an idea is sometimes more easily done by calling a python notebook in a python code.
It is as dirty, filthy and ugly as a wild hairy swine with horns...
But if you can prove the value of your idea, why not try it out immediatly with `boar`.

## Installation

Requirements:
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

The package is available on pypi: [https://pypi.org/project/boar/](https://pypi.org/project/boar/)

To install, execute:

```bash
pip install boar
```

## Practice

I used this method in CI tasks to make sure tutorials associated to a project stay up-to-date.

I would not recommend relying this trick on a long term product.
